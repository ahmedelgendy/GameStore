## Notes

* MVVM is used as UI Design Pattern, Itâ€™s more testable in comparison to the MVC design pattern.
* I added a new layer for repositories which is responsible for fetching data from different sources (Services, Cache, Storage), that lets the rest of the app retrieve the data easily.
XIB files is prefered over Storyboards because it makes it easy to inject whatever we want into the view controller constructor during initialization.
* Since hardcoding resources names (Fonts, images, colors) is not a good practice, I used R.swift which generates strong typed assets.
* To increase app performance I used KingFisher library which caches images.
* UserDefaults is used to cache requests responses using requests url(as a key), however, the solution needs enhancements for cleaning the cache periodically.
